After [I left Domestika](https://blog.davidmp.es/the-one-with-my-experience-at-domestika) last year, I decided to take some time off. After a few weeks I started taking lots of courses mainly related to clean code, DDD, software architecture, TypeScript and other similar stuff. 

I spent a lot of time putting those learnings into practice completing challenges from real companies that I found on the internet, so until March 2024 I didn't start looking for a new job. 

As you can imagine, one of the first questions every HR person always asked me was what I had been doing all that time.

In the past, I always found a new job within a month, so I hoped it would be the same this time. **Little did I know how hard is to find a good job these days.**

Usually I only apply to companies that I'm insterested in and for roles where I consider   I could be a good fit. Even so, I have failed a lot during these last few months. I made some mistakes but I definitely think I am better prepared to get a good job than I was before.

In any case, I too think that some of those mistakes are the result of **hiring and interviewing processes that I consider to be broken**. But that is an story for another time.

[Dealing with failure is not an easy task](https://workscounselingcenter.com/dealing-with-failures/). As time went on and failures piled up, at some point I even doubted whether I would ever be able to get a new job. If you are in the exact same situation, my advice is not to give up. Look at what you can do better and keep trying.

I'm not going to lie to you. You probably need to adjust your expectations as well. And that's exactly what I did.

After three hard months, I am really excited to tell you that I finally landed a new job at [SNGULAR](https://www.sngular.com/) last month.

Working for a consulting agency was not in my plans, but I liked the proposal of SNGULAR to work exclusively for an American fintech company developing their own product. Among other benefits, I will have the possibility to continue [working remotely](https://blog.davidmp.es/the-one-about-my-experience-working-remotely).

During this first month and as part of my onboarding, I have been teaching Ruby to some colleagues in the company. Next month I will start the onboarding with the fintech company and, at some point, I would like to share some of my experiences working for an American company.

Thank you for reading and see you in the next one!
