Today I was migrating an old project repository from GitLab to a private repository on GitHub when I found an unexpected error.

First I changed the remote repository:

```bash
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:backpackerhh/my-repo.git
```

After that, I pushed changes to the new remote repository:

```bash
$ git push -u origin main

Counting objects: 100% (438822/438822), done.

remote: fatal: pack exceeds maximum allowed size (2.00 GiB)
error: remote unpack failed: index-pack failedB | 3.79 MiB/s
To github.com:backpackerhh/my-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] main -> main (failed)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:backpackerhh/my-repo.git'
```

Notice the error message:

> remote: fatal: pack exceeds maximum allowed size (2.00 GiB)

After some research, I found the [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72977369/1477964) on StackOverflow, as usual.

What it basically does is take the range of the commits it needs to push and then goes and pushes them one by one.

Open your Git configuration file:

```bash
$ vim ~/.gitconfig
```

At the end of that file paste following lines:

```bash
[alias]
    partial-push = "!sh -c
        'REMOTE=$0;BRANCH=$1;BATCH_SIZE=100;
        if git show-ref --quiet --verify refs/remotes/$REMOTE/$BRANCH; then
            range=$REMOTE/$BRANCH..HEAD;
        else
            range=HEAD;
        fi;
        n=$(git log --first-parent --format=format:x $range | wc -l);
        echo "Have to push $n packages in range of $range";
        for i in $(seq $n -$BATCH_SIZE 1); do
            h=$(git log --first-parent --reverse --format=format:%H --skip $i -n1);
            echo "Pushing $h...";
            git push $REMOTE ${h}:refs/heads/$BRANCH;
        done;
        git push $REMOTE HEAD:refs/heads/$BRANCH'
    "
```

Run following command after saving those changes:

```bash
$ git partial-push origin main
Have to push 16063 packages in range of HEAD

In case you have any really large file in your version control, at some point you will see a message like the one that follows:

```bash

```

But the process will continue, so nothing to worry about.

It took some time, but on the end it did the job as expected.

Thank you for reading and see you in the next one!
